# Airplane Crash Analysis :airplane:

As of right now the only code that can be executed is all the code that is seen in the `airplane_notebook.ipynb`. You can open the notebook and run all the cells but this may take over an hour, we performed multiple grid searches and tested multiple types of models. We made it so that our output is already shown when you open the notebook. You do not have to re-run the cells to see the output! Any figures that are generated are also shown in the `images` folder in this repo.
